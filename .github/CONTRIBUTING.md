## Steps before creating a Pull request

1. Please ensure that the file has a comment-block at the top following these norms:
   * First line contains the company name followed by college name and year that the problem
     appeared in. If multiple candidates apply, add them with newlines
   * Next block of lines explains the Problem Statement clearly
   * Next block contains the constraints for the variables appeared in the problem statement
   * Next few lines (optional) has a brief explanation of your approach and/or link to the problem
   * Last line (optional) mentions the [runtime complexity][run] of your code
2. Please try to write clean and indented code. Sparsely occuring concise comments are also fine
   but not mandatory.
